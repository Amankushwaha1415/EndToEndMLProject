# End To End ML Project
## Food Delivery Time Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the **delivery time of food orders** based on multiple factors such as distance, traffic, weather, food preparation time, and time of day.  
The aim is to provide more accurate estimates for customers and improve efficiency for food delivery platforms.


## Project Objectives
- Clean and preprocess raw data for training.
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to find patterns and insights.
- Engineer meaningful features like traffic conditions, order time, and weather.
- Train multiple ML models and select the best-performing one.
- Deploy the model using **Flask** and create a simple **web application** for real-time predictions.


## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, various ML agorithms 
- **Backend**: Flask  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
